# Melbourne Housing Prices
This reposiroty is my encounters with the [Melnourne Housing Snapshot](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot) dataset.<br>
<br>
I've done the exploratory data analysis of the dataset a clear understanding of terms and trends.<br>
<br>
I developed a Polynomial Multiple Linear Regression model with degree 3 to train the model which contained 15 parameters. The dataset had 13,580 examples which I splitted into 10,864 training examples and 2,716 test exapmles.<br>
Upon training the model on train set and testing it on test set my model achieved an R<sup>2</sup> score of 70.93%.<br>
